# ShutterSeekers-V1

Greetings everyone,

I am thrilled to announce the development of an exciting new app designed specifically for photographers. Our app will help photographers discover and capture iconic landmarks and picturesque locations through recommendations and reference photos shared by fellow enthusiasts. This will not only enhance your photography experiences but also enable you to gauge the quality of composition at these locations.

Currently, we have successfully implemented the image upload feature and demonstrated the integration with Google Maps. With your support, we aspire to create a valuable resource for photographers and tourists alike, enabling them to create lasting visual memories.

Thank you for joining this community and supporting our mission. If you are interested in contributing to the coding aspect of the project, please react to this message, and I will update your role to 'coder,' granting you access to specialized chats.

Together, we can turn this vision into reality.

Version 1:
-Upload image and write description code functional
-Ability to click once to set the marker, and once again to upload information functional
-Marker location is saved, with information, though on a local database


Changes required:
1-each blue marker stores the same information, not the information input during its creation
2-instead of using the image of a map, Google Maps API should be used(the issue is saving marker location, I am unsure how to do that)
3-Create a login and register page

To edit changes, add the reaction to which number you will solve. Please also add suggestions. Thanks.
